# Brief

My goal is to make posts like this the SIMPLEST place on the internet to learn how to do things
that caused me trouble. That way, if this is found, someone doesn't have to do the same digging I had to do.

# What is Spring AI?

TODO

- lay out ai explanation
- explain MCP
- explain Ollama
- explain how this is a demo of these things working together
- diagram
- explain testcontainers and running tests
- lay out bare minimum code and dependencies needed to bootstrap
