Hi, I'm Steve. I like 3d printing, have 11 cats with my wife, and really enjoy working with new technology.

I've worked in retail, tax software and aerospace industries, and in all of those positions I was always pushing the limit
as far as I could. Always trying to use bleeding edge tools where I can!

This blog is my first attempt at technical writing, and the main goal is to write articles that I wish I had found. I couldn't
count how many times I've dug through Github issues or old forums trying to solve an issue, so when I come across a solution that required
a mountain of research, I write about it here! Similarly, a lot of articles and posts only contain partial or non-functional examples.

I hate that, so I aim for my posts to actually be useful to whoever comes across them! (Or me, 6 months from now)

## This Site

This site is a copy of the astro project by https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper. 

I previously had a site made in Jekyll, but
very quickly I struggled to get Jekyll to do what I wanted. From
there I found a template I liked, made sure to stay within the license requirements, and get to work writing!
