I'm a senior software developer doing devops and development work.
I've worked in retail, tax software and aerospace industries, and in all of those positions I was always pushing the limit
as far as I could. Always trying to use bleeding edge tools where I can!

This blog is my first attempt at technical writing, and the main goal is to write articles that I wish I had found. I couldn't
count how many times I've dug through Github issues or old forums trying to solve an issue, so when I come across a solution that required
a mountain of research, I write about it here! Similarly, a lot of articles and posts only contain partial or non-functional examples.

I hate that, so I aim for my posts to actually be useful to whoever comes across them! (Or me, 6 months from now)

I also write on my substack, which is a little less technical and sometimes a bit more personal. You can find that at [https://substack.com/@stevenpg1](https://substack.com/@stevenpg1).

## This Site

This site is a copy of the astro project by https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper. 

I previously had a site made in Jekyll, but
very quickly I struggled to get Jekyll to do what I wanted. From
there I found a template I liked, made sure to stay within the license requirements, and get to work writing!
