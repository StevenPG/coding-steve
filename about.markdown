Welcome! I'm Steve

I'm a 30 year old software developer starting his first blog. Partly as a 
way to record my thoughts, partly to document things that don't get documented.

My hobbies mostly including; poking at software and hardware, taking care of our 11 cats
and trying to feed a diminishing interest in cars.

I'm trying to get into blogging *gestures around*.
