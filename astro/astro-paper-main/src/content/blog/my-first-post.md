## The Hook

TODO - update with Astro migration

What do I write on my first post under the "Tech Posts" section of this blog? It's gotta be something
tech related... And the only thing on my mind is this blog made with Jekyll. So I'll write a little
bit about my setup and Jekyll!

TODO - replace this with Astro migration, keep jekyll stuff

## How these pages were built

Shout-out to [Chad Baldwin][chadbaldwin.net], who's blog I came across when I started searching on how to
get this Jekyll thing up off the ground. He created a really cool bootstrapping github template that I
planned on using, but I like to understand tools by messing with them myself.

His site was the inspiration for this one!

So I jumped over to [Jekyll's Install][jekyll-install] and got it installed on my Mac.

Speaking of my local machine, I do nearly all of my work on a steeply discounted Apple M1 Pro I picked up
right when the M2 Pro released.

In the spirit of open source, I've been cross referencing Chad's blog
and the official Jekyll documentation.

Once I got everything installed, I kicked off the process with `gem install jekyll` and
got to creating!

## Building the Blog

As soon as I had jekyll installed, I ran `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This created
a _site and .jekyll-cache and started serving my site locally.

I quickly found myself in over my head at this point, and went through the step by step
tutorial available [on jekyll's docs page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)

From there, I created a _layouts folder and set up the format
I wanted by default (default.html), and for my home page (home.html).

[The layout docs are right here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/)

I followed the instructions in the Blogging section of the step-by-step and took some
inspiration from Chad's repository, and separated my posts into personal and tech.

As of this post, that's where I am now!

I'll be updating the site, and everything (including all my commits and history) will be
available [in the github repository that serves this site!](https://github.com/StevenPG/coding-steve)
