## The Origins

This is actually the second iteration of my blog, the first was built using Jekyll. That worked pretty well until I started wanted to configure the themes... things started to get a little hairy if you went
outside the template, and I found myself creating a new template.

I started digging and found Astro! It looks like Astro is used by a TON of companies, and plenty of bloggers, so I figured I'd try it out.

It's pretty simple, and I do a lot of React for work so I was pretty comfortable!

My original blog was a carbon copy of the template set up by Chad Baldwin, who has his template running for his own blog at chadbaldwin.net, so shout-out to him for getting me started!

THIS blog is built off of astro-paper, repo available here: https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper

It was extremely simple to convert everything and I'm happier with the customizability AND the default layout.

There's still a lot to learn about Astro, but I'm ready to dive in a document it all! (And everything else I wish I'd found online)
